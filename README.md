# 🛡️ AI-Powered Threat Intelligence Feed Aggregator - Final Implementation Roadmap

## 🚀 Setup & Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd AI-ThreatIngestor
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Install Ollama (AI Service)
```bash
# macOS
brew install ollama
# Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
# Windows: Download from https://ollama.ai/download
```

### 4. Start Ollama and Pull a Model
```bash
ollama serve &
ollama pull tinyllama   # Or: ollama pull llama2
```

### 5. Initialize the Database (First Time Only)
**Why?** The dashboard and all processing require a database with the correct tables and schema. This step creates the `threat_intelligence.db` file and all necessary tables. If you skip this, the dashboard will not work!
```bash
python populate_db.py
```

### 6. Launch the Dashboard
**Why?** This is the main web interface for all features: real-time monitoring, AI analysis, IOC extraction, and search. All core workflows are accessible here.
```bash
python simple_dashboard.py
# Visit http://localhost:7862 in your browser
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Setup & Quick Start

### 1. Build and Run with Docker Compose
**Why?** Docker provides a reproducible, isolated environment with all dependencies (Python, Ollama, database, etc.) pre-configured. Use this for easy deployment or if you want to avoid local setup hassles.

#### Production (recommended for most users)
```bash
docker-compose up -d threatingestor-prod
# Visit http://localhost:7862 in your browser
```

#### Development (for code changes, Jupyter, etc.)
```bash
docker-compose --profile dev up -d threatingestor-dev
# Visit http://localhost:7863 in your browser
```

**Note:**
- The Docker container will automatically initialize the database if it does not exist.
- Ollama and the required AI model will be installed and started inside the container.
- All dashboard features are available via the web interface.

## Project Overview
Transform the existing ThreatIngestor into a comprehensive AI-powered threat intelligence platform with a modern web dashboard and LLM (Large Language Model) integration.

- [x] Implement proper indexing for fast searches

#### 1.2 Enhanced IOC Extraction
- [x] Improve regex patterns for IOCs
- [x] Add extraction for: CVEs, YARA rules, Bitcoin addresses
- [x] Implement confidence scoring for extracted IOCs

#### 1.3 Feed Source Expansion
- [x] Add GitHub threat intel repositories
- [x] Integrate security blogs (Krebs, Schneier, etc.)
- [x] Add vulnerability feeds (NVD, MITRE)

---

### **Phase 2: AI Integration (Days 3-4)**

#### 2.1 Ollama LLM Integration
- [x] Install and configure Ollama locally
- [x] Create LLM service wrapper
- [x] Implement threat summarization prompts
- [x] Add threat severity scoring

#### 2.2 AI-Powered Analysis
- [x] Generate concise threat summaries
- [x] Extract key threat actors and TTPs
- [x] Classify threat types (malware, phishing, APT, etc.)
- [x] Generate actionable recommendations

---

### **Phase 3: Web Dashboard (Days 5-6)**

#### 3.1 Gradio Interface Development
- [x] Create main dashboard with threat overview
- [x] Implement search and filtering capabilities

#### 3.2 Interactive Features
- [x] Threat detail pages with AI summaries
- [x] Export functionality (CSV, JSON, STIX)
- [x] Feed management interface
- [x] Historical trend analysis

---

### **Phase 4: Advanced Features (Days 7-8)**

#### 4.1 Real-time Processing
- [x] Implement background processing (threaded/async)
- [x] Add real-time dashboard updates (auto-refresh)
- [x] Create alert system for critical threats

#### 4.2 Integration Capabilities
- [x] MISP integration for threat sharing
- [x] STIX/TAXII format support
- [x] API endpoints for external tools
- [x] Webhook notifications
